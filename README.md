# StopWatch

##### This repository entails the structural modelling of a stopwatch on an FPGA in VErilog.
#### The design is broken down into smaller modules that are stacked from the simplest component to the complex ones.
#### The final top-level modules uses all the predesigned modules to realize the stopwatch.
#### The Stopwatch hhave the start, stop, store and reset functionality.
#### This documentation will be continually updated.
